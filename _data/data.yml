education:
    - degree: Master of Bioinformatics
      university: University of Wageningen
      time: Sept 2020 - Sept 2022
      details: |
        The master in Bioinformatics allows me to see what programming paradigms are used in computer science related to genetic analysis and other biological problems. 
        In bioinformatics, analysis of big datasets is key, often concerning DNA, RNA or protein sequences. 
        This master allows me to learn several skills to process large amounts of data and perform valid statistical tests to extract information. 
        My average grade was an 8.3/10.
    - degree: Bachelor of Science in Biotechnology
      university: University of Wageningen
      time: Sept 2017 - Sept 2020
      details: |
        In this bachelor several aspects of Biotechnology were explored. Like metabolic engineering of microorganisms, 
        analyzing genomic data and designing a bioreactor. 
        I also took the bioinformatics minor to get even more experience working with genomic data, programming and bioinformatic tools.

career-profile:
    title: About me
    summary: |
      As a bioinformatician I always aim to combine my technological know-how with my love for biology. I have an practical mindset
      and like to communicate with researchers and engineers to discuss ideas. While almost all of my skills related to computer science
      I have acquired outside of formal schooling, my time in university was spent to get deeper biological knowledge.
       
      Most of my programming experience is in interpreted languages like Python and JS, but I can easily pivot to AOT compiled languages like C.
      Due to my intrinsic interest in Computer Science I have much more knowledge than many other recently graduated bioinformaticians with regards to algorithm design, and
      programming best practices. I would love to put this knowledge to use in a developing oriented bioinformatics position!

experiences:
    - role: Bioinformatics Developer Intern
      time: March 2022 - July 2022
      company: ENPICOM
      details: |
        During this 4-month internship I worked on an online (IGX) platform used by immunologists worldwide. 
        I augmented a state-of-the art therapeutic monoclonal <i>in-silico</i> analysis tool and developed a 3D antibody viewer.
        This internship included extensive source code analysis in Python, coding lots of functionalities in Typescript and React and interaction
        with researchers aiming to use my tool.
    - role: Freelance web engineer
      time: 2018 - Present
      company: BartIT
      details: |
        As a freelancer I provide web consultancy and do security pentesting. 
        As an ethical hacker I have been able to help several well known dutch companies improve their security.
        Technologies I work with range from HTML/CSS/JS and Typescript to lower level HTTP and TCP protocol implementation analysis.

    title: Projects
    intro: >
      While some of these projects were performed in University, I have many more projects listed on my Github profile if you are interested.
    assignments:
      - title: Building a machine vision based feedback-controlled microfluidics system • Msc. Thesis
        tagline: |
          In my thesis at the BioNanoTechnology group at the WUR, I created a physical device that allows researchers
          in microfluidics to easily automate their experiments using a machine vision pipeline. This lab automation project was based
          on a cheap 3D printer, a cheap SBC and software written in Python 3 to make it accessible for every microfluidics lab.

      - title: On the usage of a TPU in mobile metagenomic analysis • Bsc. Thesis
        tagline: |
          In this thesis a new relatively novel way of using Deep Neural Networks, using a Tensor Processing Unit, was evaluated in the context
          of direct species calling using raw nanopore sequencing reads. This was based on a model by Google's AI lab.

      - title: CovidAlarm
        tagline: |
          Unlike the previous projects, this was a small business I co-founded during the pandemic to tackle social distancing. Using a sensor,
          distances between 2 devices could be measured and guaranteed at >1.5 m. I was responsible for the software implementation (in C++), the electrical engineering (including PCB design),
          and the assembly of the devices.

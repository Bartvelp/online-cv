education:
    - degree: Master of Bioinformatics
      university: University of Wageningen
      time: Sept 2020 - Sept 2022
      details: |
        The master in Bioinformatics allows me to see what programming paradigms are used in computer science related to genetic analysis and other biological problems. 
        In bioinformatics, analysis of big datasets is key, often concerning DNA, RNA or protein sequences. 
        This master allows me to learn several skills to process large amounts of data and perform valid statistical tests to extract information.  
        My average grade was an 8.3/10.
    - degree: Bachelor of Science in Biotechnology
      university: University of Wageningen
      time: Sept 2017 - Sept 2020
      details: |
        In this bachelor several aspects of Biotechnology were explored. Like metabolic engineering of microorganisms, 
        analyzing genomic data and designing a bioreactor. 
        I also took the bioinformatics minor to get even more experience working with genomic data, programming and bioinformatic tools.

career-profile:
    title: About me
    summary: |
      From a young age I've been interested in the inner workings of many different things. When I discovered biology in high-school
      I knew I wanted to persue an education in it. In the mean time I was already getting familiar with programming websites, and what common weaknesses
      are. I decided at the time that teaching myself Information Technology would be easier than teaching myself the 
      inner workings of biology, given the wealth of knowledge available online. By specializing in Bioinformatics, I've rediscoverd my love 
      for complex IT problems. I am currently working in the field of human health in relation to ML research in pathology.

experiences:
    - role: Software Engineer
      time: Oct 2022 - Present
      company: Slide Score (& Dutch Cancer Institute)
      details: |
        As a software engineer at Slide Score I've been working on designing and implementing new data structures that allow for high
        performance visualization of Machine Learning results in digital pathology. I've also introduced more modern programming practices,
        like the use of modular TypeScript and Continous Integration. Some of the technologies used are: TypeScript/JavaScript, C#, Python, Docker,
        Gitlab C.I.

    - role: Freelance web engineer
      time: 2018 - Present
      company: BartIT
      details: |
        As a freelancer I provide web consultancy and do security pentesting. 
        As an ethical hacker I have been able to help several well known dutch companies improve their security.
        Technologies I work with include HTML/CSS/JS(/TS), Python, PHP, caching layers validation.

      While some of these projects were performed in University, I have many more projects listed on my Github profile if you are interested.
    assignments:
      - title: CovidAlarm
        tagline: |
          This was a small business I co-founded during the pandemic to tackle social distancing. Using a sensor,
          distances between 2 devices could be measured and guaranteed at >1.5 m. I was responsible for the software implementation (in C++), the electrical engineering (including PCB design),
          and the assembly of the devices.

      - title: Building a machine vision based feedback-controlled microfluidics system â€¢ Msc. Thesis
        tagline: |
          In my thesis at the BioNanoTechnology group at the WUR, I created a physical device that allows researchers
          in microfluidics to easily automate their experiments using a machine vision pipeline. This lab automation project was based
          on a cheap 3D printer, a cheap SBC and software written in Python 3 to make it accessible for every microfluidics lab.
      
      - title: Bioinformatics Contest 2021 Finalist
        tagline: |
          This online contest tests the ability of contestants to implement algorithms to a novel Bioinfomatics problems in a small time
          window. I was able to pass the qualification round to proceed to the finals, and managed to finish in the top 3% of contestants.  
          This contest is organized by the Rosalind team.
